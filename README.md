# AR4-MK3 Control Software
This fork is intended for use on my personal intel based macbook only. I began modifying this repo to create optimizations that I find benefited me. If you are planning on running this on your machine you may just prefer to take the `robot_kinematics.cpython-310-darwin.so` that I have compiled. run the original `AR4.py` with python 3.10 and install the pip reqs from this fork
 

### below is the remaining readme from the AR team that still protains. 


**Version 6.3.1 – January 2025**

The **Annin Robotics AR4-MK3 Control Software** is the official open-source, non-commercial desktop application for controlling the AR4 six-axis robotic arm.  
It provides real-time joint and Cartesian control, calibration utilities, teach-mode programming, and integration with the AR4-MK3 firmware running on a Teensy 4.1 controller.
